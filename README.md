## Mandelbrot Orbits

This is a small project looking at cycles / orbits in the mandelbrot set.

The code is a mess and the repo is a mess. And it's been unsuccessful.

But it's still kind of cool.


## Bug Journal

Here lie a bunch of visually cool results which are not what I intended to produce.
